## Social Infrastructure Prediction Project

This is a comprehensive machine learning project for predicting infrastructure needs including bridges, housing, roads, and utilities.

### Project Structure
- **Data Pipeline**: Automated data collection, cleaning, and preprocessing
- **Feature Engineering**: Spatial, temporal, and infrastructure-specific features
- **ML Models**: Specialized models for different infrastructure types plus ensemble approach
- **API**: REST API for predictions and data access
- **Deployment**: Docker and Kubernetes configurations
- **Monitoring**: Logging and metrics collection

### Development Guidelines
- Follow MLOps best practices
- Use proper logging and error handling
- Include comprehensive tests
- Document all APIs and models
- Use type hints throughout codebase

### Progress Tracking
- [x] Project structure created
- [x] Core configuration files added
